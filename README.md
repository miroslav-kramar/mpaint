# MPaint
Yet another drawing / image editting program. Made in C with love and raylib.

## How to build?

Rn I would rather not explain due to some very bad decisions regarding the relative position of various raylib files the build script works with. Will improve Laterâ„¢.

## TODO

- Resolve the horrible relative path raylib includes
- Implement flood-fill algorithm
- Implement color picking
- Make it so the user cannot loose the view of the canvas
- Further split the functionality in `main.c`
- Improve functions nomenclature
